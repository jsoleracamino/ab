1-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git created a hidden folder ".git" where it will
store tracking files. By doing so, Git will store information about the changes
in the tacked files in ".git". It is necessary to initialize the repository to track
files and control version history.
