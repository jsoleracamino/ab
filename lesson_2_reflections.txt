1-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git created a hidden folder ".git" where it will
store tracking files. By doing so, Git will store information about the changes
in the tacked files in ".git". It is necessary to initialize the repository to track
files and control version history.

2-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging are contains the files that are logically related for the next commit.
It is different because the working directory contains all the files, and the repository
only tracks the commits.

3-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You have to use git add to have in the staging area only those files that are relevant
for that commit.

4-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

New branches are useful when you want to implement versions of the code, or when you want to
test changes. They help because they allow you to evolve each branch independently.

5-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The branch diagrams help me to better understand the parent-child relationship of
every commit. It is helpful also to understand how new commits are going to be related
to the previous ones.
