1-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git created a hidden folder ".git" where it will
store tracking files. By doing so, Git will store information about the changes
in the tacked files in ".git". It is necessary to initialize the repository to track
files and control version history.

2-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging are contains the files that are logically related for the next commit.
It is different because the working directory contains all the files, and the repository
only tracks the commits.
