1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Mainly, when I am working with other people. It would be useful too when working on 
different devices.

2-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid new changes that may conflict with local edits.

3-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forks: copies of GitHub repositories within GitHub.
Clone: copies of repositories (either local repositories, or local and GitHub).
Branches: series of related commits. They can be on GitHub, or in the local machine

4-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is good to have a copy of the last known state of the remote to work on the updated version.
