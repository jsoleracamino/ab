1-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Mainly, when I am working with other people. It would be useful too when working on 
different devices.

2-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid new changes that may conflict with local edits.
